{"name":"Abu-dju.GitHub.io","tagline":"This repository tries to gather some rare useful dictionaries that have fallen in the public domain (for instance: Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon)","body":"### Welcome.\r\nAll Praise is due to God and May God's Peace and Blessings be upon each and everyone of His Prophets and Messengers.\r\n\r\n### What's this site about?\r\nYou'll find in this site, rare and very useful dictionaries that have fallen in the public domain.\r\nThere are many important dictionaries out there that have not (unfortunately) been converted to machine readable formats. Those that have, are not accessible to common users. To me, what's important is to convert those dictionaries to various computer/hand-held formats available for the public.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Lane Lexicon has been made available as a machine readable format by the Perseus project and further enhanced by the Alpheios project. There exist (to my knowledge) two android versions on the PlayStore:\r\n-Lane's Arabic Lexicon\r\n&\r\n-Muggy's DictBrowser.\r\n\r\nWhile the former is a paid app that does not even have an ad-version, the latter is available as a paid and and ad app. Unfortunately there is no computer version for look-ups with free open-source softwares (except for the web versions -- perseus, alpheios)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dictionary Formats\r\nOn this site, you will be able to download versions of these dictionaries in open-formats. I intend to provide for the time being, God Willing, the following formats:\r\n\r\n1. StarDict (*.ifo | *.idx | *.dict.dz)\r\n2. MDict (*.mdx | *.mdd)\r\n3. Dictd (*.dict.dz)\r\n4. XDXF (*.xdxf)\r\n5. DSL (*.dsl)\r\n6. Babylon (*.bgl)\r\n7. DictionaryForMIDs (*.jar)\r\n8. Comma-Separated-Value (*.csv)\r\n\r\nNote that for the first 6 first formats, namely from StarDict to Babylon, they are all supported by the GoldenDict PC version. As for the Android version i am not sure. Anyway, there are plenty of free and open-source dictionary look-up applications that support there formats. As I see fit, more formats will be added, God Willing.\r\n\r\n### About the Dictionary files\r\nThe following dictionaries shall be available when the \"digging\" will finish:\r\n\r\nArabic-English:\r\n-Edward Willam Lane: An Arabic-English Lexicon\r\n-H. Anthony Salmoné: An Advanced Learner's Arabic-English Dictionary\r\n\r\nLatin-English:\r\n-Lewis: A Short Latin-English Lexicon\r\n\r\nGreek-English:\r\n-Henry George Liddell: An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon\r\n-G. ABBOTT-SMITH: A MANUAL GREEK LEXICON OF THE NEW TESTAMENT\r\n-Robert Scott: A Greek-English Lexicon\r\n\r\nFrench-French:\r\nLe Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française de 1935 (8ème Edition)\r\nLe Dictionnnaire de la Langue Française d'Emile Littré.\r\n\r\nNote that the last two French dictionaries are already available in StarDict format. I will only provide some further enhencements and convert them to the other formats.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the latest news.\r\n\r\nN.B: this is a work in progress, everything will be published when I'll be done, God Willing.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
